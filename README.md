### Install all the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How does it work?

The text recognition is made on cropped part of a larger image, usually these crops are made with the bounding box output of an [Object Detection](https://docs.theos.ai/get-started/object-detection) model. You can learn how to build a license plate recogition model on the following [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVLUVxTpqG0). After training your own object detection model, you can pass those cropped bounding boxes to Easy Paddle OCR to perform text recognition.

### Read the text
On the **read.py** file we recognize the text of 3 different cropped bounding boxes, each taken from larger images.

Let's recognize all of them with the following command.

```
python read.py
```

You should now see the following output.

```
[+] image: broadway.jpeg
[+] text: BROADWAY
[+] confidence: 98%
[+] inference time: 39 milliseconds

[+] image: brooklyn.jpeg
[+] text: BROOKLYN
[+] confidence: 96%
[+] inference time: 31 milliseconds

[+] image: casino.jpeg
[+] text: CASINO
[+] confidence: 78%
[+] inference time: 30 milliseconds
```
